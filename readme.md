About:

You can use this application to add flowers and get notifications from app when you need to water them. You can choose appropriate time to get this notifications. Your phone will vibrate when notification triggers. Also you can make photo of flowers and use it as avatar for flower.


Plugin:
----

I've created plugin that makes alert. Developer can choose one of five themes for alert: light, holo-light, dark, holo-dark or traditional. You can see this alert when you've added a new flower (holo-light theme) or when you are deleting flower (holo-dark theme). App automatically loads this plugin from my github repository- https://github.com/igor0ser/FlowerAlert
